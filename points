Clustering is a decentralized solution. Everything is automatic. 
Data is distributed, moved, rebalanced automatically. Nodes gossip with each other, (though it may cause group isolation).

Sharding is a centralized solution. 
If we get rid of properties of clustering that we donâ€™t like, sharding is what we get. 
Data is distributed manually and does not move. Nodes are not aware of each other.
